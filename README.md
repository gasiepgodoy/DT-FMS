# DT-FMS - Asset Administration Shell
Repository of the project for the Digital Twin of Flexible Manufactring Systems

Here are the files for the AAS used in the project. Still under development.
V2.0 onwards works with individual files for each station instead of a global archive.
This was done to achieve edge-computing capabilities.

Current Version is 2.1.1 with Operational Data and Simulated Data for all stations.

After Downloading the file, export the XML file (see below) to C:\ProjetoGemeo\AAS\"Station".
