Config flies are divided into two diferent categories:
1. The folder structure: config.csv (For verison 5.7.3 and older) of nodeset (For version 6.0 onwards)
2. the s7endpoint file, that maps the variables for the S7 library.

The folder structure must be inserted into the specific folder "C:\ProjetoGemeo". To chage that the code must be altered in the CSV file on the main tab of the program for version 5.7.3 backwards or on the path of the nodeset file in the OPC UA Server node for versions 6.0 onwards.
