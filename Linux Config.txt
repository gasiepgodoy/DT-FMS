Procedure to Download and configure  TV BOx Linux 

In Linux Terminal:

For each station, create a folder in main root directory (using the commands below) and Download the raw files from GitHub, renaming them

mkdir ProjetoGemeo			//Creates project Directory
cd ProjetoGemeo
mkdir AAS					//Creates AAS folder to hold files
cd AAS
mkdir "Station"				//Creates the folder for each Station (Distribution, Handling1, Handling2, Master, Processing, Sorting, Testing)
cd Station
curl -O "raw File"			//Take the raw file path from GitHub. Current V2.1 version below:

Distribution: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gasiepgodoy/DT-FMS/refs/heads/Node-Red-Software/2025-04-28%20-%20V2.1%20nodeset%20Distribution.xml
Handling1: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gasiepgodoy/DT-FMS/refs/heads/Node-Red-Software/2025-04-28%20-%20V2.1%20nodeset%20Handling%201.xml
Handling2: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gasiepgodoy/DT-FMS/refs/heads/Node-Red-Software/2025-04-28%20-%20V2.1%20nodeset%20Handling%202.xml
Master: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gasiepgodoy/DT-FMS/refs/heads/Node-Red-Software/2025-04-28%20-%20V2.1%20nodeset%20Master.xml
Processing: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gasiepgodoy/DT-FMS/refs/heads/Node-Red-Software/2025-04-28%20-%20V2.1%20nodeset%20Processing.xml
Sorting: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gasiepgodoy/DT-FMS/refs/heads/Node-Red-Software/2025-04-28%20-%20V2.1%20nodeset%20Sorting.xml
Testing: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gasiepgodoy/DT-FMS/refs/heads/Node-Red-Software/2025-04-28%20-%20V2.1%20nodeset%20Testing.xml

mv "finename" nodeset.xml	//Makes the name of the file correct for the system. The file name is listed on the folder and can be seen with the "ls" command.

after the file is downloaded and renamed, check if file is ok with the command below, that should return the header of the file.

head nodeset.xml

In Node-red:

On each Server node, insert the correct path to the nodeset file:

/root/ProjetoGemeo/AAS/"Station"

On each CSV node, insert the correct path and file name (the file is created and updated by the flow)

/root/ProjetoGemeo/AAS/"Station"/Variables.csv
